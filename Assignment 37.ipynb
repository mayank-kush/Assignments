    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (outcome).\n",
    "It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that a change in the independent variable corresponds to a constant change in the dependent variable.\n",
    "The equation for simple linear regression is typically represented as: Y = a + bX, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, a is the intercept, and b is the slope.\n",
    "Example: Predicting a person's weight (Y) based on their height (X).\n",

    "Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression and is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.\n",
    "It allows for the consideration of more complex relationships and multiple factors influencing the dependent variable.\n",
    "The equation for multiple linear regression is typically represented as: Y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn, where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ..., Xn are the independent variables, a is the intercept, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the respective slopes for each independent variable.\n",

    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. You can check this by creating scatterplots of the variables and looking for a roughly linear pattern.\n",

    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. You can check this by plotting the residuals against the predicted values and looking for a consistent spread of points.\n",
