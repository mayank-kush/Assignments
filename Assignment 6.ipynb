    "Ans : A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects, specifying what data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or operations) the objects will have. Classes act as user-defined data types, encapsulating data and functionality into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a classâ€”a concrete representation of the class blueprint. It is a runtime entity that holds its own unique data (values for attributes) and can perform actions (invoke methods) defined in the class. When you create an object, it occupies memory space, and you can interact with it by accessing its attributes and invoking its methods."

    "Ans : \n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically called a class. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary interfaces to interact with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on relevant characteristics and behaviors. It allows you to create a blueprint (class) that defines the structure and behavior of objects without getting into the specific implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and allows you to create a hierarchy of classes with shared characteristics and specialized features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different data types or objects and allows you to create code that can work with objects of multiple types in a generic way. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding."
