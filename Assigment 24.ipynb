    "Nature: Nominal data, also known as categorical data, consists of categories or labels used to classify items into discrete groups. These categories have no inherent order or ranking.\n",

    "Examples: Examples of nominal data include gender (categories: male, female), eye color (categories: blue, brown, green), or types of fruit (categories: apple, banana, orange).\n",
    "Mathematical Operations: Nominal data does not support mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, or multiplication because there is no meaningful numeric value associated with the categories.\n",
    "Analysis: Statistical analysis of nominal data typically involves calculating frequencies, proportions, or conducting chi-square tests to examine relationships between categories.\n",
    "Ordinal Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature: Ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful order or ranking. While there is an order, the intervals between categories may not be equal or meaningful.\n",
    "Measurement Scale: Ordinal data is at a higher level of measurement compared to nominal data. It includes the concept of ranking without precise measurement.\n",
    "Examples: Examples of ordinal data include education levels (categories: high school diploma, bachelor's degree, master's degree), customer satisfaction ratings (categories: very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied), or socioeconomic status (categories: low, middle, high).\n",
    "Mathematical Operations: Ordinal data allows for ranking and making qualitative comparisons. You can say that one category is higher or lower than another, but you can't perform meaningful arithmetic operations, such as finding the average, because the intervals between categories are not uniform or quantifiable.\n",
    "Analysis: Analyzing ordinal data often involves non-parametric statistical methods like the Mann-Whitney U test or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. These methods take into account the order of the categories but do not assume that the intervals between them are equal."

You might conduct a clinical trial with a sample of patients, administer the drug to one group (experimental) and a placebo to another (control), and then compare the outcomes.
