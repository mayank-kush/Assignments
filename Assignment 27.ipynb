According to the CLT, the distribution of sample means (averages) of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. This makes it possible to apply statistical methods to a wide range of data, even when the data itself is not normally distributed.\n",
